# 📘 Assignment: Python Data Visualization

## 🎯 Objective

Learn to create professional charts and graphs using Python libraries (matplotlib and plotly) to visualize data and communicate insights effectively.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1 — Create Matplotlib Visualizations

#### Description
Use matplotlib to create static visualizations of sample data. You will practice creating different chart types and customizing their appearance with titles, labels, and legends.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create at least two different chart types (e.g., line plot, bar chart, scatter plot, histogram)
- Add descriptive titles and axis labels to all charts
- Include a legend where appropriate
- Customize colors and styling for clarity
- Save at least one chart as an image file (e.g., PNG)


### 🛠️ Task 2 — Create Interactive Visualizations with Plotly

#### Description
Use plotly to create interactive, web-based visualizations. Explore plotly's interactivity features such as hover tooltips, zoom, and pan capabilities.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create at least two interactive charts using plotly
- Include hover information that displays data details
- Add interactive features (hover tooltips, clickable legend items)
- Display at least one 3D visualization (optional but recommended)
- Save visualizations as HTML files or display them in the browser


## ✅ Starter Code

Starter code is provided at `assignments/python-data-visualization/starter-code.py`. It includes sample datasets and template functions to help you get started.

## 🧰 Files

- `README.md` — this assignment description
- `starter-code.py` — starter code with sample data and template functions
- `sample-data.csv` — sample dataset for visualization (optional)

## ▶️ How to run

Run the starter script with Python 3:

```bash
python3 assignments/python-data-visualization/starter-code.py
```

Make sure you have matplotlib and plotly installed:

```bash
pip install matplotlib plotly
```

## 📎 Attachments

You may create additional Python files or datasets as needed. Save any generated chart images or HTML files in the assignment folder.

## 📝 Submission

Submit your completed code by:

1. Pushing your modified `starter-code.py` and any additional files to your repository
2. Including generated visualizations (PNG images or HTML files) in the submission
3. Adding a brief description of what visualizations you created in your commit message
