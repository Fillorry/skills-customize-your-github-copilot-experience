# 📘 Assignment: Games in Python — Hangman

## 🎯 Objective

Build a playable Hangman word-guessing game in Python to practice string manipulation, control flow, and user input handling.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1 — Implement Hangman

#### Description
Create a command-line Hangman game that:

- Chooses a random word from a list
- Prompts the player to guess letters
- Reveals correctly guessed letters in the word
- Tracks remaining attempts and guessed letters
- Ends with a win or lose message

#### Requirements
The completed program should:

- Randomly select words from a predefined list
- Accept single-letter guesses and ignore repeated guesses
- Display the word progress using blanks (e.g., `_ a _ _ e`)
- Track and display remaining incorrect attempts
- Show a final win or lose message

## ✅ Starter Code

Starter code is provided at `assignments/games-in-python/starter-code.py`. Use it as a starting point and add your game logic there.

## 🧰 Files

- `README.md` — this assignment description
- `starter-code.py` — starter code for the assignment

## ▶️ How to run

Run the starter script with Python 3:

```bash
python3 assignments/games-in-python/starter-code.py
```

If you create a new script, run it similarly, e.g. `python3 hangman.py`.

## 📎 Attachments

Place any additional assets or sample word lists in the assignment folder. The starter repository currently contains the starter code.

## 📝 Submission

Submit your completed script by pushing to your repository or uploading a ZIP containing your modified `starter-code.py` and any additional files. Include a short description of changes in your commit message.
